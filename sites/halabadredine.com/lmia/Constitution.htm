     <p class="style1"><strong>Lebanese Medical Informatics Association</strong><br />
         <strong>Mission Statement</strong><br />
       The <strong>Lebanese Medical Informatics</strong> <strong>Association </strong>is a non-profit,  non-governmental organization based on the voluntary work of Health  professionals and Computer Scientists with a special interest in Medical  Informatics.<br />
       The purpose of the association is to promote the use of the  Telecommunications and Information Technology in Medicine or, perhaps more  accurately, in the Health sector. This technology is viewed as a means to  improve the services offered by the Health Care Delivery System, decrease their  cost and decrease loss of time in services’ delivery.<br />
       In Europe and elsewhere, during the last  decades, information technologies have played a decisive role in the dramatic  developments, not only in diagnosis, treatment, and surveillance, but also in  the more collective aspects of healthcare and health prevention, such as  clinical trials, Epidemiology, and health education. We are looking forward as  The Lebanese Medical Informatics Association to a jumlaje  with The International Medical Association. <br />
       One of the most effective ways to promote the use of Information Technology  is to educate Health Professionals. Amongst our activities, along these lines,  are the organization of educational seminars, conferences, discussion groups  and other activities that promote research, progress and enhancement of the  application of information technology in the health sector. There is reason to  believe that professionals who will not be able to absorb and use the new technology  will not be able to stay current in their field and ultimately serve their  patients as effectively as possible.<br />
       As we are proceeding towards the realization of LMIA  as part of the IMIA, new legal and ethical issues are becoming more evident.  We, as professionals, should participate in the formation of the ethical and  legal framework for the use of information technology in the health sector.<br />
       Finally, in order to promote its purposes, LMIA  will seek co-operation with local institutions, the relevant authorities in Lebanon especially  The Ministry of Public Health and The Ministry of Higher Education as well as  allied organizations and agencies of the European Union, USAID, IMIA and other  countries.<br />
