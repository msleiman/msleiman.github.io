     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p align="center" class="style1" dir="ltr">About Me</p>
     <p align="justify" dir="ltr">In the widest and   wisest sense, all written work portrays an image of the writer. Hence, words   reveal the person. This is why I decided to tackle directly and immediately an   image of me using words as color bristles on canvas. I will courageously reveal   my real personal virtues as well as my vices, my built, mettle, mood and   capabilities, rather than cowardly use affectations. I will not use circuity to   conceal my nature. Thus, I will spare the reader the hardship of deduction from   an indirectly and impersonally written piece of work. As a matter of fact, I   will try to inform about myself by choice of the skill, by choice of the style,   by choice of the language and by the choice of the breadth in order to shape and   expose this subject matter. While the subject handles my personality in a direct   sense from its two facades; my public personality and my private personality.</p>
     <p align="justify" dir="ltr">  </p>
     <p align="justify" dir="ltr">I am a thirty one   years’ old Lebanese woman. As compared to Middle Easterners I am of average   height that is I am neither tall nor short. I am not fat but fit. I have a very   white complexion during winter while my skin progresses to a bronze color   through the summer. Resembling my fathers’ eyes, mine are big olive colored with   high eyebrows and long eyelashes. Eyes wide enough to contract almost all what   goes around. My nose is reasonably retroussee with a slight bone deviation   caused by a basketball plunge into my face twenty years ago. Being fond of milk   and yogurt, my teeth turned into a candid white color. My mouth is proper enough   to convey what is appropriate of words only. Finally, my neck is fit in a way,   raising my head high above my shoulders.</p>
     <p align="justify" dir="ltr"> </p>
     <p align="justify" dir="ltr">Most of the people   happening to sight me think that I am supercilious for the first glance. But   when they get to know me, they get to discover that I am less snooty than an   infant. However, I have serious, calm and peaceful face expressions. A smart   rather than stupid smile is naturally animated on my face when appropriate. Some   people sometimes are vexed by my smile misunderstanding it as mocking,   ridiculing or satirizing. Moreover, I control quite very well my gestures in   reaction to what goes around despite the reflection in my eyes that mirrors   whatever invigorates my soul. </p>
     <p align="justify" dir="ltr"> </p>
     <p align="justify" dir="ltr">Speaking of mettle,   I learned to control my temper in most of the demanding situations. I learned to   be neither crushed by defeat nor overwhelmed by victory. Through the 31 years of   my life I faced situations where any human might have been crushed by grief,   sorrow and frustration but I stood up with pride and fortitude. Some of the   situations that life has brought on me are the death of a father, the deception   of a husband and the loss of a son. Three indispensable realities helped me to   overcome pain and change the hideousness of such misfortunes into beauty and   Art. These realities are first God’s will, second my biological predisposed   endurance and third taking advantage of the power and usefulness of my brain;   that is a human brain. By means of art, I exemplified the capability of man in   creating beauty and marvel out of hideousness. On the other hand, I was gifted   with great fortunes some of which are high frustration tolerance, artistic   talents and chances to explore my talents, facility of being loved and entrusted   by others, strong character, fair looks, a gifted son and a lot more. More of   God’s gifts to me is the ability of being happy. For my mind, heart and soul are   overwhelmed with a sparkling shining feeling of happiness and zeal whenever I   experience grand marvels of Art like music and poetry, whenever I hear the voice   of my love, whenever I play with my son or whenever I see the wonders of God’s   creations that we sometimes take as foregranted. Moreover, I also gained   happiness and strength through the healing power of prayer. Speaking more of   character and mettle, I have an unforgivable fault, especially in the opinion of   psychology and pedagogy. This is my lavish and uncontrollable passion for my   only child that sometimes betrays the logic rules of mind. On the other hand, in   all other instances I display mastery in managing my temper and censoring the   reactions and patterns of my behavior.</p>
     <p align="justify" dir="ltr"> </p>
     <p align="justify" dir="ltr">Moreover, everyone   who had known me witnessed my leadership spirit and capabilities since my early   years. In saying so, I am not trying to assume more merit than I claim. My   achievements in this sense, I have proven my words. I had been a scouts’ leader   for seven consecutive years. I founded a new division in The Lebanese Boyscouts   Association in the year 1989.I also founded The American University of Beirut   Alumni Association South Lebanon Branch. I had been the branch’s president for   three years. Then I was elected a president for another consecutive term of   three years. Not diving into the crux of leadership acts, I gained the trust and   respect of these groups by practicing  leadership’s simple yet critical acts   like holding responsibility, uniting and motivating colleagues, friends and   members of the mentioned groups, guiding and stimulating them towards common   goals and interests, transforming our potentials and dreams into reality,   acquiring self and others’ respect, using successful, human and public relations   and utilizing proper communication means and skills. Actually these experiences   enriched my character and increased my knowledge in many ways, especially in the   fields of management and public relations. In the same matter, I added to the   success in many perspectives for the groups that I lead and the organizations   that I managed. “The Girl Scouts, the Red Cross, the pastoral churches- our   nonprofit organizations- are becoming America’s management leaders.” says Peter   Drucker. With great respect to and accordance with the distinguished pillar in   management; Drucker, I believe that nonprofit organizations are a more   interesting, promising and succeeding bodies of management. As a matter of fact,   attaining my master’s degree in health services administration, being a general   manager of a couple of hospitals in Lebanon, and being in other managerial   positions, have helped me gain managerial knowledge and experience. While, being   the leader and founder of some nonprofit organizations fortified my managerial   skills in a unique way.</p>
     <p align="justify" dir="ltr"> </p>
     <p align="justify" dir="ltr">About my background   and mold, I come from an ancient family which had been proven<span dir="rtl"> </span>by historical facts   to be descending from the Arabic profit some fourteen centuries ago. I am the   only child to a Sheeait father and a Maronite (Catholic Middle Eastern Sect)   mother who is at the same time half Greek. Thus, embodying the utopian and   impossible mélange in a sectarian community, in which its members are unaware   and unconscious of their faulty inherited sectarian attitude. For this reason   and for being raised up in a well reputed school in the Middle East that has   attracted multinational students over the last two centuries and for a lot more   I preach, practice and work hard for a nonsectarian and comprehensive society.</p>
     <p align="justify" dir="ltr"> </p>
     <p align="justify" dir="ltr">Moreover, I owe my   family and school a great deal in the process of molding my personality from the   positive point of view. The biological predispositions which I inherited from my   family has been shaped, reinforced and channeled greatly by personal   experiences. </p>
     <p align="justify" dir="ltr"> </p>
     <p align="justify" dir="ltr">I have encountered   those experiences in the course of ever growing at my family, my school, my   country and even our globe. In this sense, I inherited the face, the language   capacities, the adaptation capabilities, the perseverant attitude, the artistic   spirit, talent and the insatiable quest for knowledge and education from my   father and his family. On the other hand, I inherited my body build, my mood,   the capability of sound judgment, the foresightedness and the sixth sense from   my mother. </p>
     <p align="justify" dir="ltr"> </p>
     <p align="justify" dir="ltr">More about my   family, one urologist living in Köln- Germany, one pharmacist living in   Barcelona- Spain, another lawyer, calligrapher, poet and painter living in   Montreal- Canada, one physician, poet, writer, speaker and Lebanese X deputy   parliament member at God’s heavens, another economist who earned his Ph-D’s from   The University of Oxford, researcher, writer and painter living in Ryad- Saudi   Arabia and my father, a mathematician and successful businessman who died in   1972; all are the sons of  “Sayed” Sobhi Badredine. My grandfather Sayed Sobhi   Badredine was an appreciated, learned and famous landlord in the south of   Lebanon. Here “Sayed” is an Arabic title given to members of the noble family.   It means”the noble one” in English. As a consequence, being one of them, a   Badredine, I inherited their hunger for ever attaining knowledge and continuing   education as well as their desire to experience different expressions of arts   and sciences at the same time. Finally, I inherited the Badredines’ lust for   traveling and learning about new cultures and societies that is a characteristic   which depicts our personalities with a wide multinational flexible spirit. </p>
     <p align="justify" dir="ltr"> </p>
     <p align="justify" dir="ltr"> As I have depicted a lot   of my public personality or the perspective of myself that people directly view   in me. Now I shall reveal more of my private personality. I shall uncover   partially the part of my personality which includes my special and intimate   thoughts, emotions, memories and experiences. Though it is an arduous matter for   one to analyze one’s own personality, it is greatly informative and educative   about oneself and for oneself. Thus, I, surprisingly; am discovering that my   private personality is much more complicated than I suspected. As a matter of   fact, I have embodied some of this private   personality since twenty years in artistic means of expression as its volume   expanded bursting out of my heart as ink and words on papers and colors and   shapes on canvas.</p>
     <p align="justify" dir="ltr">  </p>
     <p align="justify" dir="ltr"> Consequently, I revealed   my private personality in Arabic prose and poetry as well as oil and aquarelle   paintings, unintentionally. On the other hand, I could have revealed these   private expressions of my inner sole subconsciously intentionally taking in   account the science of psychology point of view. Moreover, some more pieces of   my private personality are glanced in paintings that I have accomplished. My   seventeen painting exhibitions in Beirut, Dubai, Abu Dabi and Cyprus oscillated   between surrealistic and realistic subjects and styles. Being fund of exploring   my own psyche, I have used water and oil colors to materialize the images of my   imagination and my dreams. Just, as well, I used words to symbolize my unveiled   feelings and thoughts through a real figurative embodiment as Arabic poetry.   Thus, I have published a lot of written pieces in many Lebanese well known   journals and newspapers. Those pieces included poetry and prose in Arabic   language and handled a bunch of topics varying from Lebanese and Middle Eastern   political and social concerns, Lebanese hospital concerns, to motherhood, love   and sacredness. I signed my first published poetry book in June 2002 in Beirut   under the auspices of His Excellence The Lebanese Minister of Culture; then,   Dr.Gassan Salameh. In a common tract, I have been the chief editor of The   American University of Beirut Alumni Association Mount Lebanon and South Lebanon   Branches’ monthly journals since the year 1995. The previously mentioned tasks   added more to my public as well as private personality. On the other hand, I   added humble touches and ineffaceable achievements to them in return.</p>
     <p align="justify" dir="ltr">  </p>
     <p align="justify" dir="ltr"> How to end writing <strong> about me</strong>? From a remote position, through looking at the portray that I have   painted through the previous words; I can see that it can never be complete. I   revealed a part of me. I wrote about my public and private personalities. Hence,   some of my traits like mood, temper, mettle, preferences, talents, behavior and   spirit. I also tried to describe some sides of my physical characteristics, my   inherited predispositions, some indelible experiences of my life, my family, my   environment and some of my achievements. Some readers may view these   characteristics as negative others might view it oppositely. But, after all, I   have tried to reveal my nature turning away from indirection. That is me.</p>
